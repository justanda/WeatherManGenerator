The Weather Dashboard is a React application that allows users to search for and view current and 5-day weather forecasts for cities worldwide. This app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to provide up-to-date weather data and includes a search history feature for easy city selection. Built with TypeScript and styled with React-Bootstrap, the dashboard is optimized for a clean and user-friendly experience.
